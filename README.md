# Simon-tsangs-frontend-dev-portfolio


## Description
This working portfolio will showcase all the web development projects that I have completed to future employers and clients who are interested in my services. I have laid out the website so its easy to navigate with a nav bar and CTA buttons before the scroll to help users see my work or contact me for further information.
